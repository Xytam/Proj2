                In order to obtain the BEST advice about course
                selection, degree progress, and academic policy,
                please meet with a representative of the
                department that administers your NEW major.<br><br>
                You can find advising contact information for your
                new major on the Office for Academic and
                Pre-Professional Advising Office’s
                <a href="http://advising.umbc.edu/departmental-advising/">Departmental Advising
                    page</a>. That contact person/office will be
                            able to give you instructions on how to schedule
                            an advising appointment with someone in that
                            area.<br><br>

                Good luck with your new major!<br><br>

                If you selected “Other” in error, click the button to
                return to the previous screen<br><br>

                <input id="backtoRegister" type="button" value="Back"
                       onclick="window.location='../../html/forms/register_student.php';"/>

                <?php
            } else {
                ?>
                <form method="post" action="post_registration.php">

                What are your current post-UMBC plans? For example: Medical School, Teach
                middle school science, Research career, Master’s/PhD, etc.<br>
                <textarea maxlength="1000" rows="4" style="width: 100%" name="plans" required></textarea><br>
                Do you have any questions or concerns that you would like to discuss during
                your advising session? For example: Withdrawing from a course, adding a
                second major, etc.<br>
                <textarea maxlength="1000" rows="4" style="width: 100%" name="questions"></textarea>
                <br><br>
                Note: Certain questions and concerns may require more time for discussion than a student’s Registration Advising appointment will allow. If your question or
                concern is complex, or is sensitive in nature, you may be asked to schedule a
                follow-up appointment with an advisor to address it fully.
